# Suitable Frontend Task

1. Build the page using these design specs:
    - Desktop: https://www.figma.com/proto/bDqEQ5WiwXMKTwAKmJxhqQ/Untitled?node-id=1%3A4&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1
    - Mobile: https://www.figma.com/file/lf8yFFCbFaqCvOPmV9XmA3/Referral-Status-Card-Mobile?node-id=0%3A1&t=4oAhU1QobtzxeL9j-1
3. You don't have to build an exact replica of the design, you can skip stuff like icons and other small things that will take time off building the actual UI. 

**There is no need to build any backend (api layer, server, database).**

## Duration

**Between 24-48 hours.**

## Submission
1. **Has to be built with React**
2. **Should be responsive** (Mobile, Tablet and Desktop) (Size < Desktop, the list layout should switch to vertical with name at top, smaller step ladder in middle (progressing horizontally) and lastly, the amount)
3. DO NOT build using any UI/component library
4. The input box at the top should search the list by name
5. **Mail the submission to sambhav@suitable.ai with link to your repo and the live website** where we check the code and UI respectively.
